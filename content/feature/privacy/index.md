## Privacy policy

Feditext doesn't collect your personal information. We don't use any kind of tracking or analytics in the Feditext app.

However, Feditext is a client for your Fediverse instance. Each instance will have its own rules and privacy policy that you should familiarize yourself with before signing up with the instance. Due to the nature of federation, most instances share your account information and posts with other instances. Some instances may also share your personal information with third parties, for example, when implementing CAPTCHAs.

You can find your instance's rules and privacy policy on its web page. For example, the `mastodon.social` instance's privacy policy can be found at https://mastodon.social/privacy-policy, and the `pixelfed.de` instance's privacy policy can be found at https://pixelfed.de/site/privacy. If you can't find the rules or privacy policy for your instance, contact your instance administrator.
