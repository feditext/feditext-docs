alt="Feditext screenshot of a conversation thread. atavisticAdventurer replied to Shaun, Lord of Coffee: @barista_king i've heard of coffee! but only from Ancient datashards! how did you find it?! how do you get it to grow? Shaun, Lord of Coffee replied to atavisticAdventurer: @atavisticadventurer We don't grow it ourselves. (Not unless this shop really takes off and we can start working with a grower.) Usually we have it imported through City Beanery. atavisticAdventurer replied to Shaun, Lord of Coffee: @barista_king so i used the terminal to search for 'beanery' and it gave me an error message and then this thing tried to flatten me, with an attached picture of a large glowing robot."

Feditext is based on [Metatext](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext), which is no longer maintained. Feditext has been updated with Mastodon 4 features (editing posts, exclusive lists) and better support for non-Mastodon instances (rich text rendering, emoji reactions), and is under active development.
